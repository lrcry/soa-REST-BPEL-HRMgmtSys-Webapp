# soa-REST-BPEL-HRMgmtSys-Webapp
Webapp of HRMgmtSys
## Deployment
Make sure you have Apache 2 server installed on your computer. You also need to deploy other three relative projects on your computer as well:  
[HR Management System RESTful service](https://github.com/lrcry/soa-REST-BPEL-HRMgmtSys)  
[HR Management System SOAP service](https://github.com/lrcry/soa-REST-BPEL-HRMgmtSys-SOAP)  
[HR Management System BPEL server](https://github.com/wq1456728/soa-BPEL-HRMgmtSys)
- Pull or download the project to your computer
- Create a directory named "hrmgmtsysweb" under your Apache 2 root directory.
- Directly copy the content of directory "WebContent" into it.
- In your browser, type ```http://localhost/hrmgmtsysweb``` to access it. (Here the assumption is you are using port 80 for Apache server)
